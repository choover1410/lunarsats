ECE6390 Project

# Overview: 
The expected outcome of this project is to
achieve a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility and effectiveness of different
configurations as described above, providing insights into the performance of PaddleSat
constellations for Lunar missions.

# Key Questions
1. Given a groundstation(s) and
2. given a constellation of paddle-like satellites** (PaddleSats),
assess
a. groundstation accessibility coverage
b. downlink quality to groundstation
c. downlink/uplink accessibilit to Geo/Earth
c. downlink/uplink quality to GEO/Earth

**:
# PaddleSat parameters to explore can include:
1. Area density
2. Orbit(s)
3. Sat quantity per orbit
4. ...

# TODO:
- Validate 3BP in 3D
- Specify test scenarios
    + What defines a deviation from orbit? Closeness of the following pass?
- Generate appropriate plotting
    + 3D time-variant scatter plot of position, Moon-fixed
    + Altitude vs Time
    + Grav. Force vs. Time
    + Max. Potential Solar Force vs. Time
